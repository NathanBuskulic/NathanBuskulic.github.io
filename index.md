## About Me

Hi! I am a Ph.D. student at Université de Caen in Normandy, France, under the supervision of Jalal Fadili and Yvain Quéau. My work focuses on the theoretical aspects of deep learning when used to solve inverse problems. I am particularly interested in the guarantees that one can achieve with deep learning to help applying this technology to critical domains.

## News

- **[September 2023]** The full journal version of our work on convergence guarantees of DL applied to inverse problems is on arxiv.
- **[May 2023]** Our paper won the best paper award of SSVM.
