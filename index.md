## About Me

Hi! I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Machine Learning center of Genova (MaLGa) working mainly with Luca Calatroni. My work focuses on the theoretical aspects of deep learning when used to solve inverse problems. I am particularly interested in the guarantees that one can achieve with deep learning to help apply this technology to critical domains. I obtained my Ph.D. from Université de Caen in Normandy, France, under the supervision of Jalal Fadili and Yvain Quéau.
